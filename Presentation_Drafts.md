# Presentation Drafts - Jan 31, 2026

## Section 1: Common Group-wise Capstone Project Presentation

### Slide 1: Title & Information
- **Project Title:** DocuHub: An Integrated SaaS Solution for Scalable Technical Documentation and Knowledge Sharing
- **Group Members:** Manish Kumar & Team
- **Date:** January 31, 2026

### Slide 2: Selection Source (CRITICAL)
- **Sources for Selecting Project Title:**
  1. **Industry Benchmarking:** Studied leading technical documentation platforms like **GitBook**, **ReadMe.io**, and **Docusaurus** to identify gaps in user-friendly "SaaS-ready" documentation hubs.
  2. **Community Trends:** Analyzed the "Documentation-as-Code" movement on **GitHub** and **Hashnode**, focusing on how developers prefer to manage content using Markdown and Vite.
  3. **Problem Analysis:** Observed the fragmentation of technical notes in small teams, leading to the idea of a centralized "Hub" with export capabilities.

### Slide 3: Project Overview
- A modern, premium documentation portal built to handle technical guides, API docs, and architecture diagrams.
- **Key Focus:** Minimalist UI, blazing-fast performance (Vite), and developer-centric features (Markdown export).

### Slide 4: Core Features
- Dynamic Documentation Management
- Built-in Smart Markdown Editor
- Dark/Light Mode with Persistence
- Bulk Export to ZIP (Markdown files)
- Sticky Notes for quick insights

## Section 2: Individual Research Paper Presentation

### Slide 1: Research Paper Title
- **Title:** "A Systematic Analysis of Modern Web-based Documentation Frameworks: Efficiency, Security, and Developer Experience (DX)"

### Slide 2: Abstract
- This paper explores the evolution of technical documentation from static HTML pages to interactive, dynamic SaaS platforms. It evaluates the impact of Markdown-based workflows on developer productivity and compares performance metrics between traditional Content Management Systems (CMS) and modern SPAs (Single Page Applications) like React/Vite. The study concludes with recommendations for optimizing documentation security and searchability.

### Slide 3: Introduction
- Technical documentation is the backbone of software maintenance.
- As software architectures become more complex, the need for "living documentation" that updates in real-time is crucial.
- Modern frameworks (React, Vue, Vite) have revolutionized how we serve and consume this information.

### Slide 4: Literature Survey / Problem Statement
- **Problem Statement:** Traditional documentation systems often suffer from poor searchability, slow update cycles, and a high barrier to entry for non-technical contributors.
- **Literature Review:** 
  - *Reference 1:* Smith et al. (2023) highlighted the 40% increase in developer onboarding speed when using interactive docs.
  - *Reference 2:* Jones (2024) discussed the security vulnerabilities in client-side document rendering.
  - *Current Gap:* Lack of integrated frameworks that combine "Small Notes" (micro-content) with hierarchical long-form documentation.

### Slide 5: Selection Source (CRITICAL)
- **Sources for Selecting Research Paper Title:**
  1. **Google Scholar / IEEE Xplore:** Searched for keywords "Technical Documentation Efficiency" and "Markdown Lifecycle Management".
  2. **ResearchGate:** Analyzed recent studies on "Developer Experience (DX) in Software Tooling".
  3. **Seminal Papers:** Inspired by Brooks' "No Silver Bullet" and its discussions on documentation complexity.
